# QA-Project-NeuralNetFall2021

This project involves creating a QA system and attempting to train it to answer increasingly complex questions, the end goal being to measure its success or improvement in answering questions from Jeopardy! after starting with more basic questions.

The following 3 sources were used for ideas to build and train the QA system in Python:

Additionally, the following source will be used for the theory behind implementing a QA system:

A portion of the dataset provided by https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/200000-jeopardy-questions will be used for building a database for subject matter and answers.
